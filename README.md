# MOTIF — Model Of Transformations In Fields

**Experimental, graph-native research for JAR;VIS.** The native unit is a change to a typed relational field—not a text token. MOTIF explores what happens when a system learns reusable transformation schemas and composes them into hypothetical futures.

This is a research sandbox, **not** a pretrained LLM, a real-world causal model, an autonomous agent, or evidence of permission. All demonstrations are deliberately invented. No external calls or actions occur.

## Working experiments

- **[001 — Named transformation induction](experiments/001/VISION.md):** Learn role-relative graph rewrites from labeled synthetic `before/action/after` episodes. Discover a synthetic repair → teach → repair chain.
- **[002 — Birth of an unnamed verb](experiments/002/DESIGN.md):** Infer action *schemas* from unlabeled `before/after` graphs. Identify recurring local changes, discover anonymous graph-rewrite operators, and compose them to reach new hypothetical states.

### Run (Python 3.10+, standard library only)

```sh
cd experiments/001
python motif.py
python -m unittest -v test_motif.py

cd ../002
python motif002.py
python -m unittest -v test_motif002.py
```

The suites also run on GitHub Actions with no paid services or API credentials.

## Research laws

- **Hypothesis ≠ observation.** Simulated futures cannot amend observed history.
- **Structure ≠ causality.** Correlated transitions do not establish why events occur.
- **Graph permission fact ≠ real-world consent.** The hard gate is a synthetic demonstration only.
- **Learned rule ≠ capability to act.** Neither experiment can affect external systems.
- **New verb ≠ novel model architecture.** Program induction, graph rewriting, and planning have substantial prior art; originality remains to be proven through controlled benchmarks.

## Next frontier

Train on varied, noisy, partially observed transitions with unlabeled agent roles, failures, ambiguous preconditions, and held-out relation types; compare against a deterministic rule learner and a graph-network baseline under identical budgets. The goal is falsifiable prediction of changes in *reachable future capabilities*, not flattering descriptions of emergence.

This repository is a standalone science lab. A future JAR;VIS integration must use explicit, reviewed contracts rather than treating generated scenarios as reality.
